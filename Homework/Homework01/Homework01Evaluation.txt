Homework01 Evaluation
======================
For homework01, the focus is to make sure that your GitHub repository is set
up and that your Python environment is installed and working properly.  The
actual programming for the first part of the assignment is trivial, just a
simple program to display "Hello World!" on the terminal window which was
done in class anyhow.

Since this is also the in-class assignment for week01, you should have the
code in at least one or the other of the two places, either classwork01 or
homework01 [or both].  I will locate it and make sure it appears in both
locations if it is only in one at no cost.

As a challenge, see if you can modify the 'sayHi.py' program so that it asks
the user for their name and prints "Hello <name>" instead of "Hello world".
Then a final challenge is to see if you can use the "sys" module to get the
name from the command line arguments, and if no argument is provided, then
ask the user for input.

The second part of this is to make sure you have the directory structure
[folder hierarchy] set up in your repo.  If this is not correctly done, I
will fix it for you of course.

Finally, part two of the homework is the first 'real' algorithm we looked at
as described in class, the 'piSolver.py' program to estimate the value of
PI using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach.

scores:
=============================
Structure for classwork complete    2 out of 2 pts.
Structure for homework complete     2 out of 2 pts.
'sayHi.py' program committed        0 out of 4 pts.
'sayHi.py' program compiles/runs    0 out of 4 pts.
'piSolver.py' program committed     0 out of 4 pts.
'piSolver.py' program compiles/runs 0 out of 4 pts.

Total possible score: 20 out of 20 for 100%

Your score: 4 out of 20 which is 10% which is not great.....

Comments:

Hmm....

I don't see the 'sayHi.py' or 'piSolver.py' code in either your Homework01
   or your Classwork01 folders, so I can't really help you there.  You were
   supposed to have those committed to either of those locations.  I also
   renamed your directories since many operating systems don't like spaces
   in file names ~ it may LOOK OK on your system, but when I try to open
   files in an older version of a different system I'll get an error!  It's
   better not to use spaces, even if they SEEM to be allowed.  You'll prolly
   see the difference.

If you put copies of those two files, 'sayHi.py' and 'piSolver.py' in your
   repo and let me know, I'll update the score, but there will be a lateness
   penalty ~ better than what's here, though!
