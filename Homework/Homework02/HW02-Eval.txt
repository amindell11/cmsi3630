Homework02 Evaluation
======================
For the HighArray.py source file, be sure to use good coding practices to
make your code pretty, artful, and maintainable.

You must add a "getMax()" method to the HighArray.py file, which returns
the largest "key" [another word for "value"] in the array.  You must also
add a "noDups()" method which will scan through the array elements to find
and remove any duplicated values.  For example, in the array that contains
"33 33 33 44 44 55 55 66" the result should be "33 44 55 66".  Be sure to
research the way python handles lists ~ it will make your life easier!

For the HighArrayApp.py file don't include this code in the same class file
as "HighArray.PY".  You should have two separate files for this, both in
the same directory, so that you can 'import' the 'HighArray.py' file as a
'module' into the 'HighArrayApp.py' program.

Submit both your source code files to your repo.  THERE MUST BE TWO PYTHON
SOURCE FILES IN YOUR REPO FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.

I have mentioned in class that it is a good idea to have a small "header"
section in your files.  If you elect to include that in this assignment,
you will get two extra credit points.  You can use either the "#" tags or
the 'triple tic' comment method for block comments, which ever you like.

There are a total of 20 points for this assignment as shown below.  If you
get extra credit it is possible to get more than 100% for the assignment.

Comments:

Nice work here!  I laughed at the military spin you put on your prompts to
   the user.  When I first ran it and saw the comments I almost spewed my
   coffee on the screen!  Humor is always appreciated...

Great recovery on this assignment ~ be sure to get the homework/classwork
   numbers one posted, OK?

Keep up the good work.

Copy that, viper three.... viper command out....
